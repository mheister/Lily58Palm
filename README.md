# Lily58Palm
Forked from [kata0510/Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58)

Modified Lily58 Pro PCB with
- one of the thumb buttons moved down as a palm key, and
- outer columns staggered lower.

The keyboard was intended as a backup solution in case my Keyboardio Model 01 ever breaks,
or gets left at work.

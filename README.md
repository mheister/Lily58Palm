# Lily58Palm
Forked from [kata0510/Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58)

Modified Lily58 Pro PCB with
- one of the thumb buttons moved down as a palm key, and
- outer columns staggered lower.

The keyboard was intended as a backup solution in case my Keyboardio Model 01 ever breaks,
or gets left at work. As there is not yet a case or plate for this I recommend using PCB
mount switches.

- [PCB](https://github.com/mheister/Lily58Palm/tree/master/PCB)
- Case design has not yet been adapted
- Uses the [qmk_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) for Lily58, see
  [qmk_keymap/mheister](https://github.com/mheister/Lily58Palm/tree/master/qmk_keymap/mheister)
  for an example keymap
